# Sentiment Analysis on Financial News
Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT (pre-trained Model) on Financial News (only Headlines), that have been published while the stock market was closed. (Websites will be parsed after closing and before opening ---> Unique rows will be uploaded on database)
## Why only News outside opening hours? 
1. The Sentiment Analysis will be used as an additional KPI for Risk Management in (Algo)Trading to support calculation of confidence intervals and thresholds.
2. Other Traders are definitely faster - therefore the News itself cannot help to gain an edge.


### Motivation
>"There are three ways to make a living in this business: be first, be smarter, or cheat. Well, I don't cheat. And although I like to think we have some pretty smart people here in this room, it sure is a hell of lot easier to just be first." - Margin Call

But to be first to use market data, you would need to be in an optimal physical location (depending on the stock exchanges) and you have to have the fastest connection. Neither of those is true for me and many others. So to be successful - in this analogy of margin call - you would have to design/manipulate a unique set of data - and therefore be first again.
