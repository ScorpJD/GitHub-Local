\f0\fs24 \cf0 Why not use NLP on specific stocks (e.g. only news articles on AAPL )?\
My assumption is, that no (retail) investor will make a decision on one single (normal) news headline.\
But the entirety of the current market sentiment, might be a predictor of volatility and hence daily risk appetite. Therefore we are going to analyse the total addressable market of media outlets. (Also there are already too many (large) market participants who analyse the sentiment by single stocks for news articles and social media/forum posts \{e.g. r/wsb\}\'97 so not an opportunity for stat arb!)}
